2) Fragments were first added as a modular components in 2011 honeycomb version with introduction of motorolla Xoom

3)Fragment is a modular component that is a part of an activity,

-> define layout for the fragment you extended class from the fragment API
-> then add a fragment statically inside the XML layout activity and
-> keep their name tag in the XML level of the activity of the fragment with the fragment class that you have created
-> Don't forget to at the ID property in the activity XML of the fragment tag


//2.part

-> Replace the fragment tag in the XML of the activity with the placeholder such as relative layout or
linear layout or fragment layout but preferably it would be better to use a fragment container view

-> we need to APIs one of them is fragment transaction API to which we have to use a fragment manager API to get hold of it

-> using fragment transaction API we can add remove or replace a given fragment

-> make sure to get a support fragment manager so that it is backward compatible with the app compact activity
